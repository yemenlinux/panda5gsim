# Panda5gsim
Panda5gSim is a game engine-based 3D simulator for 5G/6G air-to-ground (A2G), ground-to-Air (G2A), air-to-air (A2A) communication channels on urban environments. 

Panda5gSim Features:
* Generate synthetic urban layout based on the built-up parameters of the ITU-R P.1410-5.
* Simulate 3D mobility for UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles) and ground users.

* Collects transformations of the UAVs and ground users in the 3D space.

    Collects ray-tracing line-of-sight (LoS) status for directional and omnidirectional antennas on the UAVs.

    Implements the 3GPP 3D channel model and other popular models especially the LoS probability models.

    Use PandAI for mobility and pathfinding of the UAVs and ground users.

    Can model communication networks in urban environment and simulate the performance of the networks.

    We used Panda5gSim im sojourn time modeling for UAVs and ground users.
